Holdem Calculator

The Holdem Calculator library calculates the probability that a certain Texas Hold'em hand will win. This probability is approximated by running a Monte Carlo method or calculated exactly by simulating the set of all possible hands. The Holdem Calculator also shows how likely each set of hole cards is to make a certain poker hand. The default Monte Carlo simulations are generally accurate to the nearest percent. Accuracy can be improved by increasing the number of simulations that are run, but this will result in a longer running time.
